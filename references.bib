abstract="This work presents experimental validation of the position and orientation workspaces of the Stewart--Gough platform (SGP) considering the extensions of the prismatic actuators only. Although it is known that the workspace volume of parallel mechanisms is limited by several other factors, such as link collisions and gain-type singularities, essentially the workspace of SGPs is observed to be determined principally by the range of motion of the actuated and un-actu
ated joints.",

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed description of the experimental determination of the natural frequencies of the Stewart platform manipulator. The experimental data is validated against a FEM model developed in the Ansys software. An overall match of the respective frequencies shows the efficacy of the experimental procedure conducted. The proposed work paves the way for multiple developments like parameter identification, the design of dynamically isotropic parallel mechanisms, vibration rejection devices and the development of machine tools for precision engineering. The experiments are conducted considering multiple materials for the moving platform, and the natural frequencies are determined for each case. The experimental procedure and its elaborate description are the significant contributions of this work.},
